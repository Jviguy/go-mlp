# Introduction
I was honestly bored and was looking for things to do and decided to take another stab at making a neural network.
This time I had used some help from this article: https://madeddu.xyz/posts/neuralnetwork.
A good bit of the code is straight up stolen (as I don't know calculus all that well) so all credit goes to the author of the article.

I did try to make it more so mine and started by rewriting it and trying to optimize, but in the end I wanted to see it atleast work.
So skidding it was. I'm planning on doing a rewrite soon though.

# Use Case
At the moment this network is setup specifically for the Iris dataset. I'm planning on making it more generalized in the future.

# Iris Dataset
I have included the dataset as well as my trained version of the network.
I managed to get it to a 96% accuracy which is pretty good for a first try. I'm planning on making it better in the future.
